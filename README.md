# Hello!
This is a password codec for the classic NES title **Bubble Bobble** by Taito.

It is largely based on *(more like a carbon copy of)* the [password codec](https://github.com/bisqwit/password_codecs/blob/master/bubbob-password.php) written by [Bisqwit](https://github.com/bisqwit), only this time it is written in Python instead of PHP.

Nevertheless, my codec works in the same way as Bisqwit's.

Please let me know if you encounter any bug or if my code needs refactoring.

Special thanks to the amazing Bisqwit and his password codec.<br>Be sure to subscribe to his [channel](https://m.youtube.com/user/Bisqwit) to support him!
